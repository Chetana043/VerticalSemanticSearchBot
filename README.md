# VerticalSemanticSearchBot

## Overview
Vertical Semantic Search Bot is an ML-powered project that utilizes four different BERT models from Hugging Face to create a semantic search bot. The bot aims to provide accurate and relevant answers to user queries based on the SQuAD dataset. The SQuAD dataset, which stands for Stanford Question Answering Dataset, is employed for training and fine-tuning the some of the BERT models we've used.
